## Installation

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Set a strong value for `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in your `.env` file before starting the
> stack. The bundled demo credentials are automatically re-encrypted with the key you
> provide during the import step, so you can safely replace the default
> `super-secret-key`. If you ever customize or rotate the key that was originally used
> to encrypt the demo credentials, adjust `N8N_DEMO_CREDENTIALS_KEY` accordingly so the
> import process can decrypt and re-key them.

### Running n8n using Docker Compose

#### For Nvidia GPU users

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia up
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you have not used your Nvidia GPU with Docker before, please follow the
> [Ollama Docker instructions](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/docker.md).

### For AMD GPU users on Linux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
docker compose --profile gpu-amd up
```

#### For Mac / Apple Silicon users

If you’re using a Mac with an M1 or newer processor, you can't expose your GPU
to the Docker instance, unfortunately. There are two options in this case:

1. Run the starter kit fully on CPU, like in the section "For everyone else"
   below
2. Run Ollama on your Mac for faster inference, and connect to that from the
   n8n instance

If you want to run Ollama on your mac, check the
[Ollama homepage](https://ollama.com/)
for installation instructions, and run the starter kit as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
docker compose up
```

##### For Mac users running OLLAMA locally

If you're running OLLAMA locally on your Mac (not in Docker), you need to modify the OLLAMA_HOST environment variable

1. Set OLLAMA_HOST to `host.docker.internal:11434` in your .env file. 
2. Additionally, after you see "Editor is now accessible via: <http://localhost:5678/>":

    1. Head to <http://localhost:5678/home/credentials>
    2. Click on "Local Ollama service"
    3. Change the base URL to "http://host.docker.internal:11434/"

#### For everyone else

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
docker compose --profile cpu up
```

## ⚡️ Quick start and usage

The core of the Self-hosted AI Starter Kit is a Docker Compose file, pre-configured with network and storage settings, minimizing the need for additional installations.
After completing the installation steps above, simply follow the steps below to get started.

1. Open <http://localhost:5678/> in your browser to set up n8n. You’ll only
   have to do this once.
2. Open the included workflow:
   <http://localhost:5678/workflow/srOnR8PAY3u4RSwb>
3. Click the **Chat** button at the bottom of the canvas, to start running the workflow.
4. If this is the first time you’re running the workflow, you may need to wait
   until Ollama finishes downloading Llama3.2. You can inspect the docker
   console logs to check on the progress.

To open n8n at any time, visit <http://localhost:5678/> in your browser.

With your n8n instance, you’ll have access to over 400 integrations and a
suite of basic and advanced AI nodes such as
[AI Agent](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/),
[Text classifier](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.text-classifier/),
and [Information Extractor](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.information-extractor/)
nodes. To keep everything local, just remember to use the Ollama node for your
language model and Qdrant as your vector store.

## Using a Cloudflare Tunnel with HTTPS

If you are terminating TLS in front of the stack (for example, with a
Cloudflare Tunnel) you can let Traefik serve your custom certificate instead of
requesting one from Let’s Encrypt.

1. Place your Cloudflare-issued certificate and private key in the `certs`
   directory using the filenames `cloudflare.crt` and `cloudflare.key`.
   The files are mounted read-only into the Traefik container at runtime, so
   they should remain protected on the host system.
2. Configure the usual DNS values in your `.env` file so Traefik can match the
   incoming host header:

   ```bash
   SUBDOMAIN=my-n8n
   DOMAIN_NAME=example.com
   ```

3. Make sure your Cloudflare Tunnel forwards HTTPS traffic to
   `http://localhost:5678`. Traefik listens on port `5678` inside the Compose
   project and automatically routes the requests to the n8n container over the
   internal Docker network.
4. (Optional) If you need to regenerate or rotate the certificate, replace the
   files in `certs/` and restart the Traefik service with:

   ```bash
   docker compose restart traefik
   ```

With this setup, external clients negotiate HTTPS with your Cloudflare
certificate, while Traefik proxies the requests to n8n over the secure internal
network.

## PostgreSQL backups

The stack now includes a `postgres-maintenance` service that runs a cron job to
create database dumps with `pg_dump`. Two new environment variables control the
schedule and output path:

- `POSTGRES_BACKUP_CRON` (default: `0 3 * * *`) - Cron expression describing
  when the automatic backup should run.
- `POSTGRES_BACKUP_FILE` (default: `/backups/n8n-backup.sql`) - Absolute path
  inside the maintenance container where the dump is written. By default this
  maps to `./backups` on the host.

Backups are stored on disk so they persist across container restarts. You can
manually trigger a backup at any time with:

```bash
docker compose run --rm postgres-maintenance backup
```

To restore the most recent backup, run the restore job manually:

```bash
docker compose run --rm postgres-maintenance restore
```

The restore job stops after it finishes applying the dump, making it safe to
run only when you intend to replace the current PostgreSQL data.

## Tips & tricks

### Accessing local files

The self-hosted AI starter kit will create a shared folder (by default,
located in the same directory) which is mounted to the n8n container and
allows n8n to access files on disk. This folder within the n8n container is
located at `/data/shared` -- this is the path you’ll need to use in nodes that
interact with the local filesystem.
